---title: Bootstrap Importer Extension Source---Stewart HydeIntroduction============This extension is to aid in moving visual components of Bootstrap related toHTML over to Microsoft Blazor products and in Limited fashion to Razor Pages.This extension is an idea in connection with a 3rd party product calledBootstrap Studio but is not limited to just that product. In the extension haslimited support for non-bootstrap pages. The extension will create Razor page,move some resources, include separate CSS files which are important. Embeddedscripts in the body of html appears not be allowed in Razor pages and thus areremoved.The extension is available on Visual Studio Marketplace and this GitHub provides source for extension and support code.  Included is WPF test application that use same logic as the extension plus Unit Testing including memory based Generator testings for the 4 project types and specific units in the common modules.  The following of layout of modules includedVSBootstrapImporter 			- Actual code for Extension specific logic VSBootstrapImporter.Common		- Common logic for Dialogs and GeneratorWPFNetbootstrap				- WPF standalone application for ImporterVSBootstrapImporter.Tests		- MSBase unit testing for importerVSBootstrapImport.SetupExpected 	= Command Line application that generates in 					  memory test data for contain in files.cs  					  used for generator unit testing.The following is example screen that is can be generated without any source codemodification.![](media/9bfe47363697b0c6cd8f63835c8e9381.png)The following is visual studio dialog with options for generating the necessarycode.
